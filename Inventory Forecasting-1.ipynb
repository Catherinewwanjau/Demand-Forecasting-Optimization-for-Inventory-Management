    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective inventory management is crucial for retail businesses to minimize stockouts, reduce overstocking, and optimize ordering decisions. This project aims to enhance demand forecasting accuracy using historical sales data, seasonality, competitor pricing, promotions and weather conditions. The insights will support data driven procurement and inventory decisions to improve store efficiency and profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Develop an advanced demand forecasting model usning machine learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Identify key factors influencing demand fluctuations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Optimize Inventory levels to redue holding costs and prevent lost sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Provide actionable recommendations for procurement planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes the following key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inventory and Sales Data: Inventory levels units sold and units ordered\n",
    "* Demand Forecating: Exixting forecasted demand values\n",
    "* External Factors: Weather conditions, competitor pricing, Promotions and seasonality\n",
    "* Product and Store Information: Product category, region and store ID\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methododology\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalize features and encode categorical variables\n",
    "* Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): Identify demand patterns, trends and seasonality\n",
    "* Model development:\n",
    "    * Compare models such as ARIMA, Random Forest, XGBoost and LSTMs\n",
    "    * Evaluate model perfromacne using RSME, MAE, and MAPE\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected outcome:\n",
    "* A predictie model with improved accuracy for demand forecating.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Insights on how weather, promotions and competitor pricing impact sales\n",
    "\n",
    "* A desion support tool for procuremetn teams to enhance inventory planning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduced excess inventory and minimized stockouts, improving profitabilty\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Plan\n",
    "* Data Exploration an preprocessing\n",
    "* Model development and evaluation\n",
    "* Optimization and actionable recommendations\n",
    "* Deployment and reporting\n",
